## Quick Tests
This is a directory I made for my quick test notebooks for rapid testing of small codes.
I have added my quick tests in this repo for simplicity, but also in hopes that others could find useful.
However, I would like to note that there's no dcoumentation for these tests, and even code is not guranteed to be clean. 
So if you're sensitive to dirty code, feel free to ignore this directory; I will take no offense.
